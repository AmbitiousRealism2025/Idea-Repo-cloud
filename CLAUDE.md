# Vibe Coder Research Project - Specialized Domain Approach

## Project Overview

This project conducts deep research into tool gaps for **vibe coders** - developers who started from no-code/low-code backgrounds and are on a journey toward full-stack development proficiency.

## Research Strategy: Sequential Domain Analysis

This worktree uses a **sequential research approach** where five domains are researched one at a time:

1. **Learning & Skill Progression Tools**
2. **Development Workflow & Environment Tools**
3. **Code Quality & Architecture Guidance Tools**
4. **Collaboration & Community Tools**
5. **AI-Assisted Development & Productivity Tools**

## Your Role

You are the **research orchestrator** responsible for:

1. **Executing** five sequential research phases, one domain at a time
2. **Conducting** deep domain-specific research for each phase
3. **Creating** comprehensive analysis documents for each domain
4. **Synthesizing** all findings to identify overlapping opportunities and unique insights

## Primary Task

Execute the research plan defined in: **vibe-coder-research-orchestrator.md**

This prompt contains:
- Detailed specifications for each of the five research phases
- Research methodology and depth requirements
- Output format requirements (5 ranked ideas per phase)
- Synthesis instructions for final analysis

## Key Execution Points

### Sequential Execution
- Execute **5 research phases sequentially**, one domain at a time
- Complete each phase before moving to the next
- Create documentation for each phase immediately after research completes

### Research Requirements
- **Deep research**: Not surface-level scanning; thorough investigation of each domain
- **Current + Future**: Analyze both 2025 state and 6-12 month emerging trends
- **Flexible validation**: Agents choose their validation rigor based on domain needs
- **Creative freedom**: Balance practical and ambitious ideas without constraints

### Expected Output Structure

Create **6 markdown documents**:

1. `agent-1-learning-tools.md` - 5 ranked ideas for learning & skill progression
2. `agent-2-workflow-tools.md` - 5 ranked ideas for development workflow & environment
3. `agent-3-quality-tools.md` - 5 ranked ideas for code quality & architecture
4. `agent-4-collaboration-tools.md` - 5 ranked ideas for collaboration & community
5. `agent-5-ai-productivity-tools.md` - 5 ranked ideas for AI-assisted development
6. `orchestrator-synthesis.md` - Comparative analysis with:
   - Overlap analysis (ideas across multiple domains)
   - Unique insights (domain-specific innovations)
   - Gap categories and patterns
   - Viability patterns across domains
   - Tech stack alignment (TypeScript/React/Convex fit)
   - Recommended top 10-15 ideas with rationale

### Per-Idea Format

Each of the 10 ideas per agent should include:
- **App Name**: Creative and descriptive
- **Description**: 2-4 sentences explaining what and why
- **Gap Addressed**: Specific problem solved
- **Target User**: Vibe coder persona/use case
- **Key Features**: 3-5 core functionalities
- **Tech Stack Fit**: TypeScript/React/Convex alignment
- **Viability Reasoning**: Why ranked at this position

## Target Audience: Vibe Coders

Developers who:
- Started with no-code tools or minimal formal training
- Are actively engaging with coding and improving skills
- On path toward marketplace-viable full-stack development
- Use AI-assisted tools and prioritize rapid iteration
- Value learning through building over traditional education

## Technical Context

**Primary Stack**: TypeScript, React, Convex backend
**Platforms**: Web apps (primary), React Native for desktop, mobile if compelling
**Complexity**: From micro-tools to comprehensive platforms - no self-limiting
**Business Models**: Open source, freemium, subscription bundles - let tool dictate model

## Research Sources

**No constraints** - agents may research:
- Developer communities (Reddit, Discord, forums)
- Product platforms (Product Hunt, GitHub, AlternativeTo)
- Technical resources (blogs, documentation, framework communities)
- Social platforms (Twitter/X, dev.to, Hacker News)
- Any other relevant sources they identify

## Success Metrics

- **25 total ideas** with comprehensive details (5 per phase)
- **Deep research** evidencing thorough domain investigation
- **Clear rankings** with viability reasoning
- **Overlap identification** showing convergent market signals
- **Unique innovations** demonstrating domain expertise
- **Actionable synthesis** providing development direction

## Execution Workflow

1. **Phase 1**: Research Learning & Skill Progression Tools → Create `agent-1-learning-tools.md`
2. **Phase 2**: Research Development Workflow & Environment Tools → Create `agent-2-workflow-tools.md`
3. **Phase 3**: Research Code Quality & Architecture Tools → Create `agent-3-quality-tools.md`
4. **Phase 4**: Research Collaboration & Community Tools → Create `agent-4-collaboration-tools.md`
5. **Phase 5**: Research AI-Assisted Development & Productivity Tools → Create `agent-5-ai-productivity-tools.md`
6. **Synthesis**: Create `orchestrator-synthesis.md` with comparative analysis across all phases

## Parallel Research Context

**Note**: A parallel research effort is running in the `holistic-research` branch using a different methodology (holistic agents with validation requirements). This specialized approach focuses on domain depth, while the parallel approach focuses on cross-domain connections and validation rigor.

Together, these two research streams will provide comprehensive coverage:
- **This worktree**: Domain-deep, sequential exploration (25 ideas)
- **Parallel worktree**: Cross-domain, validated execution-ready (25 ideas)

## Getting Started

1. Begin with Phase 1: Learning & Skill Progression Tools
2. Conduct deep research for the domain
3. Create the markdown document with 5 ranked ideas
4. Proceed sequentially through phases 2-5
5. Synthesize all findings into final analysis
